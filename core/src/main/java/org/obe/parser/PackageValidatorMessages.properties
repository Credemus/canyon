0={0}: Id must be specified.
1={0} is already defined. Remove the duplicate entity or assign it a unique ID.
2={0} references an undefined {1}[{2}].
3={0}: Property {1} must be specified.
4={0}: Property {1} count incorrect: expected <{2}>, actual <{3}>.
5={0}: Property {1} value must be at least <{2}>.
6={0}: must have at least one start activity (one with no afferent (inbound) transitions).
7={0}: must have at least one exit activity (one with no efferent (outbound) transitions).
8=Activity[{0}]: the BlockActivity references an undefined ActivitySet[{1}].
9=Activity[{0}]: the SubFlow references an undefined WorkflowProcess[{1}].
10=Activity[{0}]: a Route cannot have a Performer.
11=Activity[{0}]: must include only one of: Route, Implementation, or BlockActivity.
12=Activity[{0}]: activities can only contain one synchronous deadline.
13=Activity[{0}]: is incompatible with Transition[{1}]/ExtendedAttribute[Execution].
14=Activity[{0}]: ExceptionName[{1}] is not handled by any efferent (outbound) transition.
15=Activity[{0}]: TransitionRestrictions can only contain one Join.
16=Activity[{0}]: OBE TransitionRestrictions can only contain one Split (XPDL permits more, but does not define the semantics).
17=Activity[{0}]: a TransitionRef references non-efferent (non-outbound) Transition[{1}].
18=Activity[{0}]: the Split does not reference Transition[{1}].
19=Activity[{0}]: the Split does not reference any transitions.
20=Transition[{0}]: OBE event transitions cannot be used in conjunction with an XPDL transition type {1}.
21=Activity[{0}]: an OTHERWISE transition has already been defined.
22=Activity[{0}] has {1} afferent (inbound) transitions, and therefore requires a Join.
23=Activity[{0}] has {1} regular efferent (outbound) transitions, and therefore requires a Split.
24=Transition[{0}] references an undefined 'from' Activity[{1}].
25=Transition[{0}] references an undefined 'to' Activity[{1}].
